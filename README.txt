E-Buy(Part II)
=====================
This is the second part of an E-commerce Web Application.
It is an individual project.
The attractive part of this project is that it is implemented using 3 different technologies.
The portal for the catalog is in MEAN stack (Inventory is in MongoDB). When the user clicks on the item he/she wants to purchase, website will direct him/her to the page 
where he will be asked for his login and card details.From here on, Second set of technologies i.e. JSP, Servlets and Mysql is introduced.
Third technology that I used is Python flask. It is used to implement CRUD operations on both the database (MySQL and MongoDB)
